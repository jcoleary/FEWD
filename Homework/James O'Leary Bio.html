<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm James, but you can call me Jimmy. I'm a midwestern native and I just graduated from Georgetown University last December.  I, like many of my peers am still in the process of taking the "next step in life," so to speak.  While the road ahead is daunting and lengthy, I sincerely believe I have a bright future ahead, provided I focus and work hard.  As the great Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu said, "Without dull, determined effort, there can be no brilliant success."</p>

<p>Like my life story so far, my interests are far-reaching, sometimes completely unrelated, and downright crazy but in the end form something (or someone) worthwile.  I love running and being outdoors.  I have a deep interest in learning new languages and studying the history of...well, anywhere.  I spend my free time acquiring any new information I can, be it from the media, scholarly journals, YouTube videos, or just talking to others.  I have a tendency to talk (and not stop), and talk fast.  I am working hard to try to speak more clearly and give others the chance to voice their opinions. I also love cooking, Marvel superhero movies, and of course, my hometown of Downers Grove.</p>

<p>I also love travelling. I have spent my life in many places, such as my hometown, Las Vegas, Concord, New Hampshire, Shanghai (as seen below), and Washington, DC.</p>

<p>My ethnic heritage and my religion haved been and continue to be major cornerstones in my life.  They are among the core beliefs that shape the person who is "James O'Leary." Look up at the title of the page; the characters next to"James O'Leary" are my name in Chinese.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading the above and I hope this gives you a brief description of who I am. For a more full description, advice on the future (or any other pertinent reason), please do not hesitate to contact me!</p>
